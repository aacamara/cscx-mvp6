## Codebase Patterns
- Use `IF NOT EXISTS` for all CREATE TABLE, CREATE INDEX in migrations
- Column naming: snake_case (e.g., `customer_id`, `created_at`, `last_fired_at`)
- All tables have `id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` and `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ`
- Tables with mutable rows include `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ` with a trigger function
- JSONB for complex nested data (actions, conditions, steps, stage_statuses, variables)
- RLS enabled on all tables with `GRANT ALL ON ... TO authenticated`
- Foreign keys to `customers(id)` use `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON DELETE SET NULL` depending on whether the record is meaningless without the customer
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors (171) in the codebase are unrelated to new work - SQL migrations are not type-checked
- MCP tool wrappers live in `server/src/mcp/tools/` and are aggregated in `tools/index.ts`
- Skills system is at `server/src/agents/skills/` (not `server/src/skills/` as PRD suggests)
- Automations service is at `server/src/services/automations/index.ts`
- Playbook types/executor at `server/src/playbooks/`
- Trigger engine at `server/src/triggers/engine.ts`
- DB table references: mcp_tool_executions, triggers, trigger_events, playbooks, playbook_executions, skills, skill_executions, automations, automation_runs, meeting_analyses, slack_connections

## 2026-02-04 - WA2-031
- Implemented comprehensive database migration: `server/src/migrations/022_workspace_agent_v2.sql`
- Files changed: `server/src/migrations/022_workspace_agent_v2.sql` (created), `prd.json` (updated with passes fields), `progress.txt` (created)
- Tables created: mcp_tool_executions, triggers, trigger_events, playbooks, playbook_executions, skills, skill_executions, automations, automation_runs, meeting_analyses, slack_connections
- All tables include proper indexes, RLS policies, updated_at triggers, and grants
- Column names aligned with actual Supabase queries in: registry.ts, engine.ts, executor.ts, automations/index.ts, skills/index.ts, meeting-intelligence/index.ts, slack/index.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The PRD was missing `passes` fields - added them during this iteration based on file existence analysis
  - The PRD acceptance criteria mentions `mcp_tools` table but the actual code uses `mcp_tool_executions` for audit logging (no separate tool registry table needed since tools are registered in-memory)
  - Several services/skills live in different paths than what the PRD describes (e.g., skills at `agents/skills/` not `skills/`)
  - Always grep for `.from('table_name')` patterns to discover exact column usage before writing migrations
