## Codebase Patterns
- Agent pill selectors use #e63946 accent for active state
- CS_AGENTS object in types/agents.ts defines all specialist agents with icon/name/color
- Sidebar sections use consistent styling: padding: '12px', borderBottom: '1px solid #1a1a1a'
- Compact toggle switches: 32x18px with 14px knob for tight layouts
- Two-button toggles preferred over dropdowns for binary choices (e.g., Claude/Gemini)

## 2026-01-28 23:16 - US-001: Collapse CS Specialist Agents into compact selector
- **What was implemented:** Replaced 5 large AgentCard components with compact horizontal pill/chip buttons
- **Files changed:**
  - `components/AgentControlCenter/index.tsx` (lines ~1394-1407 → new pill selector)
- **Visual change:** From ~350px agent cards to ~60px pill row
- **Functionality preserved:** Clicking pills still selects agents via handleAgentClick()
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The AgentCard component is still imported but no longer used in the main sidebar - could be cleaned up if not used elsewhere
  - Active state uses #e63946 background with white text
  - Agent description shown below pills when an agent is selected

## 2026-01-28 23:30 - US-002: Remove System Status section
- **What was implemented:** Removed the verbose System Status section from the sidebar
- **Files changed:**
  - `components/AgentControlCenter/index.tsx` (lines ~1474-1496 removed)
- **What was removed:**
  - AI Backend connection status indicator
  - Agentic Mode status indicator
  - WebSocket connection status indicator
  - Contract data loaded indicator
  - Google Workspace connection status
- **Functionality preserved:**
  - All underlying state variables (`wsConnected`, `agenticModeEnabled`, `googleConnected`, etc.) remain intact
  - Agentic Mode indicator still shows in header when active (line ~1517)
  - Google connection widget still in sidebar for taking actions
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Status information was redundant - users can tell if things work by using the chat
  - Critical status indicators should be shown inline where relevant, not in a dedicated section
  - The header already has an "Agentic Mode" badge when enabled

## 2026-01-28 23:45 - US-003: Remove standalone Google Workspace widget from sidebar
- **What was implemented:** Removed the Google Connection Widget from the sidebar
- **Files changed:**
  - `components/AgentControlCenter/index.tsx` (lines ~1474-1482 removed)
- **What was removed:**
  - GoogleConnectionWidget component and its container div
  - Import statement for GoogleConnectionWidget
  - Unused `googleConnected` state variable
- **Functionality preserved:**
  - Google Workspace connection is still accessible via Settings gear icon (App.tsx line 380)
  - GoogleConnect component in Settings modal handles all connection functionality
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When removing duplicate UI, always check App.tsx for Settings modal alternatives
  - Clean up unused imports and state variables when removing components

## 2026-01-29 00:15 - US-004: Compact the AI Model and Knowledge Base toggles
- **What was implemented:** Combined 3 separate sections (AI Model, Knowledge Base, AI Enhancement) into a single compact "AI Settings" section
- **Files changed:**
  - `components/AgentControlCenter/index.tsx` (lines ~1282-1390 → new compact layout)
- **Visual change:** From ~110 lines across 3 sections to ~85 lines in 1 section, ~50%+ height reduction
- **New layout:**
  - Two-button toggle for Claude/Gemini (more compact than dropdown)
  - Horizontal row with KB and AI+ compact switches
  - Smaller toggle switches (32x18px vs 40x22px)
  - Abbreviated labels: "KB" and "AI+"
- **Functionality preserved:**
  - `selectedModel` state still toggles between 'claude' and 'gemini'
  - `useKnowledgeBase` toggle still works
  - `useAIEnhancement` toggle still works
  - All state passed to API calls unchanged
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Two-button toggles are more compact than dropdowns for binary choices
  - Horizontal arrangement of toggles saves significant vertical space
  - Abbreviated labels work well when toggle meaning is clear from context
