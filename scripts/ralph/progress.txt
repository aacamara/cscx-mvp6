## Codebase Patterns
- Agent pill selectors use #e63946 accent for active state
- CS_AGENTS object in types/agents.ts defines all specialist agents with icon/name/color
- Sidebar sections use consistent styling: padding: '12px', borderBottom: '1px solid #1a1a1a'

## 2026-01-28 23:16 - US-001: Collapse CS Specialist Agents into compact selector
- **What was implemented:** Replaced 5 large AgentCard components with compact horizontal pill/chip buttons
- **Files changed:**
  - `components/AgentControlCenter/index.tsx` (lines ~1394-1407 → new pill selector)
- **Visual change:** From ~350px agent cards to ~60px pill row
- **Functionality preserved:** Clicking pills still selects agents via handleAgentClick()
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The AgentCard component is still imported but no longer used in the main sidebar - could be cleaned up if not used elsewhere
  - Active state uses #e63946 background with white text
  - Agent description shown below pills when an agent is selected
