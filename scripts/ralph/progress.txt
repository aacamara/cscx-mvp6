## Codebase Patterns
- App.tsx uses conditional rendering based on `isAuthenticated` from `useAuth()` hook
- Show loading spinner during `authLoading` to prevent flash of content
- Components that need auth use the `useAuth` hook from `../context/AuthContext`

## 2026-01-28 - US-006
- **What was implemented:** Integrated LandingPage component into App.tsx for unauthenticated users
- **Files changed:**
  - `App.tsx:15` - Added LandingPage import
  - `App.tsx:132-134` - Changed conditional render from Login to LandingPage
  - `components/LandingPage.tsx:9-13` - Made onLogin prop optional
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The auth flow uses `authLoading` state to show a spinner, preventing flash of dashboard before landing page
  - `isSupabaseConfigured()` check allows the app to work in demo mode when Supabase isn't set up
  - LandingPage uses `signInWithGoogle` from useAuth hook directly, so the onLogin prop is unused
