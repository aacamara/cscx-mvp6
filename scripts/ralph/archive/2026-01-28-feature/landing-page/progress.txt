## Codebase Patterns
- App.tsx uses conditional rendering based on `isAuthenticated` from `useAuth()` hook
- Show loading spinner during `authLoading` to prevent flash of content
- Components that need auth use the `useAuth` hook from `../context/AuthContext`
- AgentControlCenter/index.tsx contains the sidebar with agent selection, model toggles, and status sections
- Dark theme: bg-cscx-gray-900, text-white, accent #e63946
- Agent selection uses state hooks, preserve the selection logic when refactoring UI
