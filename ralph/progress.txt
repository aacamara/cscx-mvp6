## Codebase Patterns
- Express SSE requires res.flushHeaders() before streaming
- Use res.write() not res.send() for streaming
- Set Cache-Control: no-cache header
- AbortController handles client disconnects
- Anthropic SDK streaming: anthropic.messages.stream({...}) returns Stream object
- Stream events: stream.on('text', callback) for token deltas
- stream.finalMessage() returns the complete Anthropic.Message after stream ends
- WorkflowAgent.chat() at line 2724 of WorkflowAgent.ts — mirror this for chatStream()
- anthropic instance initialized at line 985-987 of WorkflowAgent.ts
- APPROVAL_REQUIRED_TOOLS list determines which tools need HITL approval
- executeReadOnlyTool() handles auto-approved tool execution
- Existing SSE infrastructure in server/src/routes/agents.ts lines 219-468 (use as reference)
- Existing SSE consumer parseSSEData in components/AIPanel/index.tsx line 226
- sendToAgentRegular() at line 885 of components/AgentControlCenter/index.tsx — this is what needs streaming
- The /api/ai/chat route at line 446 of langchain.ts — the streaming variant goes before it
- CADG detection in langchain.ts lines 479-543 — copy this logic for stream endpoint, but send as done event
- Session persistence in langchain.ts lines 546-562 — same for stream endpoint
- WorkflowAgent call in langchain.ts lines 567-614 — replace with chatStream() call
- Message types in AgentControlCenter use { agent, message, isApproval, routing, toolResults } shape
- Codebase has ~80 pre-existing type errors - focus on not introducing NEW ones
- Use `useAuth().getAuthHeaders()` for authenticated API calls
- Brand colors: cscx-accent (#e63946 red), cscx-black (#000000), cscx-gray-900 (#0a0a0a), cscx-gray-800 (#222222)
- chatStream() bypasses LangGraph graph and calls Anthropic directly — LangGraph doesn't support streaming callbacks
- System prompt in chatStream() is duplicated from callClaude() — future refactor opportunity
- WorkflowAgent.chatStream() added after chat() in WorkflowAgent class — same file, same class

# Streaming v2 Progress Log

Initialized: Ready to start US-001

---

## 2026-02-05 - US-001
- What was implemented: Added `chatStream()` method to WorkflowAgent class
- Files changed: `server/src/langchain/agents/WorkflowAgent.ts`
- **Details:**
  - `chatStream()` mirrors `chat()` parameters plus: `onToken` callback, `onToolEvent` callback, `abortSignal`
  - Uses `anthropic.messages.stream()` instead of `anthropic.messages.create()`
  - Listens for `text` events on stream and calls `onToken(text)` for each delta
  - After stream completes, uses `stream.finalMessage()` to get full response
  - Processes tool_use blocks identically to `callClaude()` — checks APPROVAL_REQUIRED_TOOLS, executes read-only tools, creates pendingActions
  - Calls `onToolEvent` with `tool_start`/`tool_end` around each tool execution with timing
  - Creates approval requests via approvalService for pending actions
  - Handles `abortSignal` by calling `stream.abort()` and returning empty response
  - Returns same Promise shape as `chat()`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `chat()` uses LangGraph `this.graph.invoke()` — but the actual Anthropic call is in `callClaude()` (line 2230)
  - `chatStream()` bypasses the graph and directly calls Anthropic API — necessary because LangGraph doesn't support streaming callbacks
  - The system prompt is duplicated between `callClaude()` and `chatStream()` — consider extracting to a shared function
  - `stream.abort()` can be called to cancel generation mid-stream
  - AbortSignal listeners need cleanup — use `{ once: true }` and clean up on stream end
