# CSCX.AI Strategic Planning

*Saved: 2026-02-06*

## 1. Onboarding New Users

**Current Flow:**
- Demo Mode (no auth) → Google OAuth → Connect Workspace → Import Customers

**What You Need:**

| Phase | Action | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Sign Up** | Google OAuth or email/password | ✅ Built |
| **Connect Data** | Google Workspace OAuth | ✅ Built |
| **Import Customers** | CSV upload or CRM sync | 🟡 CSV exists, CRM TBD |
| **First Value** | Guided first CADG card generation | 🟡 Could improve |

**Gaps to Consider:**
- Salesforce/HubSpot import for customer data?
- Bulk customer CSV template?
- Onboarding wizard ("Create your first QBR in 60 seconds")?

## 2. Protecting Your Idea

**Hard truth:** You can't fully protect an idea. But you can build moats:

| Moat Type | What It Means | Your Play |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Speed** | Ship faster than copycats | You're already here |
| **Data Network Effects** | More users = better product | CS playbooks, templates improve with usage |
| **Switching Costs** | Users invested in your system | Google Workspace integration, saved documents, customer history |
| **Brand/Trust** | You = the CS AI person | LinkedIn presence, design partners as advocates |
| **Domain Expertise** | Deep CS knowledge baked in | Your knowledge base, CADG methodologies |

**What You Should NOT Do:**
- Waste time on patents (too slow, too expensive, easily worked around)
- Hide in stealth (obscurity isn't protection)

**What You SHOULD Do:**
1. **Move fast** — First mover with design partners = testimonials = credibility
2. **Build relationships** — Your design partners become your moat (they won't switch)
3. **Compound the data** — Every QBR generated, every playbook used makes CSCX smarter
4. **Own the narrative** — "AI for CS" should = Aziz in people's minds

## 3. Open Questions

Before building more:

1. **CRM Integration** — Do your design partners use Salesforce, HubSpot, or spreadsheets? Should we prioritize a connector?

2. **Multi-tenant isolation** — Right now it's single-user. Do you need team/org accounts?

3. **Pricing model** — Free for design partners, then what? Per seat? Per customer managed? Usage-based?

4. **Data ownership** — What happens to their data if they leave? Export capability?

## 4. LinkedIn Post (Final Draft)

**"Complete your certifications. Write a territory plan. We'll figure out metrics later."**

Week one at the hyperscaler.

Same company published research: **40% of CSM time wasted on admin tasks.**

They weren't solving the problem. They *were* the problem.

So I quit. Built what they couldn't.

**CSCX.AI.**

One chat. QBR deck — done.
One chat. Renewal strategy — done.
One chat. Risk assessment — done.

Shipped in weeks what their committees will debate for years.

**5 design partner spots. CS leaders only.**

DM me.

*The future doesn't need your territory plan.*

**Best day to post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-10am local time
